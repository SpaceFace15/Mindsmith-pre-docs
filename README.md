# High-Level Design Document for Mindsmith<a id="mindsmith"></a>

<h1>What is Mindsmith?</h1>

[Mindsmith](https://www.mindsmith.ai/) is a tool that leverages AI to help content creators make high-level courses. It's very similar to [Rise](https://www.articulate.com/360/rise/) which is also a product that uses AI for E-learning. While both platforms leverage AI to accelerate content creation, **Mindsmith** differentiates itself by offering greater flexibility, microlearning-centered design, and fine-tuned AI editing controls, allowing creators to produce highly customized educational experiences.
This High-Level Design Document outlines the vision, scope, target audience, and key features of Mindsmith to guide its development and implementation.
